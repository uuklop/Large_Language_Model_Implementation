# Large_Language_Model_Implementation
This repository contains a custom-built Large Language Model (LLM) developed from scratch using Python.
The project showcases an exploration of PyTorch operations and examples for deep learning applications.
It aims to demonstrate concepts of neural networks, embeddings, matrix operations, and computation performance evaluations.

```bash
pip install torch
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
